# Research Agenda: The Pedagogical Physics of "Ask Pete"

## A Theoretical Framework for Nonlinear, AI-Assisted Instructional Design

This document outlines the "Cradle to Grave" theoretical framework for Ask Pete. To successfully pitch this to Purdue as a serious invention, you must prove that your "Train" metaphor isn't just a game—it is a rigorous implementation of established cognitive science.

### Part I: The Philosophical Foundation (The "Why")

Before we discuss the software, we must justify the view of the learner.

#### 1. Constructivism & The Sandbox

* **Concept to Research:** Constructivist Learning Theory (Jean Piaget & Lev Vygotsky).
* **The Argument:** Learning is not "downloading" data; it is "constructing" a world.
* **Link to Project:** Justifies the Sandbox/Garden metaphor. Prove that students learn better when they "build" or "tend" to information rather than just reading it.
* **Keywords:** Active Learning, Constructionism (Seymour Papert), Discovery Learning.

#### 2. Narrative as a Cognitive Structure

* **Concept to Research:** Narrative Psychology & The Hero’s Journey (Joseph Campbell).
* **The Argument:** The human brain organizes memory primarily through story, not lists.
* **Link to Project:** Justifies the RPG/GameLit aspect. Pete doesn't just give facts; he creates a "Call to Adventure."
* **Keywords:** Narrative Transport, Situated Cognition, Episodic Memory.

### Part II: The Cognitive Architecture (The "Physics")

Here you validate the core mechanics of your software: The Train and the Weights.

#### 3. Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)

* **Concept to Research:** Sweller’s Cognitive Load Theory (1988).
* **The Argument:** The human working memory has a finite limit (The Train Engine's Horsepower).
* **Link to Project:**
  * **Intrinsic Load:** The "Weight" of the cargo (Vocabulary difficulty).
  * **Extraneous Load:** The "friction" on the tracks (Bad UI/confusing instructions).
  * **Germane Load:** The "Fuel Burn" (Schema construction/Sandbox play).
* **Keywords:** Working Memory Capacity, Element Interactivity, Split-Attention Effect.

#### 4. The Quantified Self in Education

* **Concept to Research:** Metacognition & Self-Regulated Learning.
* **The Argument:** Students perform better when they see their own capacity limits.
* **Link to Project:** Justifies the UI feedback. If the train says "Overloaded," the student learns metacognition ("I can't handle this much yet").
* **Keywords:** Self-Efficacy, Metacognitive Monitoring, Quantified Learning.

### Part III: The Linguistic Framework (The "Cargo")

Validating the "Weigh Station" and Vocabulary focus.

#### 5. Lexical Depth & Tiered Vocabulary

* **Concept to Research:** Beck, McKeown, & Kucan’s Three Tiers of Vocabulary.
* **The Argument:** Not all words weigh the same.
  * Tier 1 (Basic) vs Tier 2 (High Utility) vs Tier 3 (Domain Specific).
* **Link to Project:** Validates your 1-100 Weighting System. You are operationalizing Tiered Vocabulary into code.
* **Keywords:** Lexical Quality Hypothesis, Semantic Networks, Vocabulary Depth vs. Breadth.

#### 6. The Role of Context in Acquisition

* **Concept to Research:** Contextual Learning.
* **The Argument:** A word ("Cargo") cannot be carried without a Story ("Train Car").
* **Link to Project:** Justifies why you force the student to use the word in a Sandbox Story before they "master" it.
* **Keywords:** Incidental Vocabulary Learning, Contextual Clues.

### Part IV: Instructional Design & AI (The "Tracks")

Validating the Authoring Tool and Pete.

#### 7. Nonlinear Curriculum Design

* **Concept to Research:** Rhizomatic Learning (Deleuze & Guattari).
* **The Argument:** Knowledge is a network (Map), not a straight line (Syllabus).
* **Link to Project:** Justifies the Node/Graph structure of the Train Yard.
* **Keywords:** Graph Theory in Education, Hypertext Learning, Networked Knowledge.

#### 8. AI as the "More Knowledgeable Other" (MKO)

* **Concept to Research:** Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD).
* **The Argument:** A student can do more with guidance than alone. AI is the scalable guide.
* **Link to Project:** Justifies Pete. Pete is not doing the work for the student; he is keeping the student in the "Zone" by managing the weight.
* **Keywords:** Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), Human-AI Collaboration, Scaffolding.

### Part V: Ethical & Institutional Impact (The "Gift")

The "Silver Platter" pitch to Purdue.

#### 9. The Open Source Imperative in Academia

* **Concept to Research:** Open Educational Resources (OER).
* **The Argument:** Education tools should be transparent ("Glass Box") and owned by the community, not rented from corporations ("Black Box").
* **Link to Project:** Justifies the Apache 2.0 License. You are giving Purdue the means of production, not just a product.
* **Keywords:** Democratization of EdTech, Vendor Lock-in, Data Sovereignty.

#### 10. Local-First Computing & Privacy

* **Concept to Research:** Data Privacy in EdTech (FERPA).
* **The Argument:** Student data (their "mind map") is too sensitive for the cloud.
* **Link to Project:** Justifies the Rust/Tauri Local Stack. The "Train Yard" exists on the student's machine, ensuring total privacy.
* **Keywords:** Local-First Software, Privacy-by-Design, Edge AI.
