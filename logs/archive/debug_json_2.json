  "reasoning": "This graph creates a non-linear learning path, allowing different Chassis configurations to approach the material from different angles. The Hero's Journey is represented by the progression from basic understanding (The Foundry) to facing challenges (Rubicon, Senate) and ultimately understanding the fall of the empire. The vocabulary words 'Rome' and 'Caesar' are integrated into the narrative. The 'logic' fields create interactive elements, rewarding understanding and penalizing failure, thus encouraging deeper engagement with the material."
